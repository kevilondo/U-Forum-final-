        <h1>What is U-Forum?</h1>

        <p>
            U-Forum is a social platform made for university students, by university students.
        </p>

        <p>
            On this platform students can sell their textbooks or any other stationery (calculators for example, you can even sell your laptop if you want, you're completely free to sell whatever you want) to other students,
            post topics and discuss with other students, share their notes and more!
        </p> 
        
        <p>
            And for journalism students and writers, you can also publish an article on our platform. Our goal is to allow students to practice what they learn at school and promote their articles.
            They can use the articles published on this platform as a reference when they apply for jobs.
        </p>

        <h1>What is our goal</h1>

        <p>
            We are aware that sometimes students struggle to sell books, some students don't have a lot friends or don't know a lot of people on campus, that's why we created this platform to facilitate the interaction between students,
            we want this platform to be a place where students find solutions to their problems and answers to their questions.
        </p>

        <h1>Who are we?</h1>

        <p>
            U-Forum was created by a former University of Johannesburg student and it's still managed by students.
